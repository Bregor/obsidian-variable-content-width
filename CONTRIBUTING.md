## Testing Guidelines

### Required Testing
Before submitting any code changes, please test:

1. **Core Functionality**
   - Both "Readable Line Length" ON and OFF modes
   - Source mode and Preview mode
   - Style Settings integration and real-time updates
   - All typography controls (H1, H2, H3, callouts)

2. **Responsive Behavior**
   - Split pane layouts (narrow and wide panes)
   - Different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
   - Container query breakpoints (900px, 1200px)

3. **Content Types**
   - Regular text paragraphs
   - All heading levels (H1-H6)
   - Tables (regular and wide)
   - Code blocks and syntax highlighting
   - Callouts and admonitions
   - Images and media
   - Mermaid diagrams
   - Mathematical expressions (if using MathJax)

4. **Theme Compatibility**
   - Default Obsidian theme
   - At least 2-3 popular community themes
   - Dark and light modes

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] No horizontal or vertical scrollbars appear unexpectedly
- [ ] Content width responds to Style Settings changes immediately
- [ ] Typography hierarchy is preserved and visually balanced
- [ ] No layout shifts or jarring visual changes
- [ ] Print/PDF export looks clean and professional
- [ ] Mobile view degrades gracefully
- [ ] No console errors related to CSS

## Code Style Guidelines

### CSS Conventions
- Use 2-space indentation
- Group related properties together
- Use logical properties when possible (`margin-inline` vs `margin-left/right`)
- Comment complex calculations and selectors
- Use CSS custom properties for all configurable values
- Prefer `clamp()` over `min()`/`max()` when appropriate

### Variable Naming
- Prefix all variables with `--vcw-set-` for Style Settings
- Use descriptive names: `--vcw-set-h1-scale` not `--vcw-h1`
- Internal variables can use `--vcw-` prefix without `set`

### Selector Specificity
- Use the minimum specificity required
- Prefer class selectors over element selectors
- Document why `!important` is used (if necessary)
- Target Obsidian's specific DOM structure precisely

### Comments
- Document the purpose of each major section
- Explain complex calculations
- Note browser compatibility requirements
- Include examples for configurable values

```css
/* =========== SECTION NAME ===========
   Brief description of what this section does
   ================================== */

/* Complex calculation explanation */
.selector {
  /* Why this calculation: responsive width with constraints */
  width: clamp(var(--min), var(--ideal), var(--max));
}
```
